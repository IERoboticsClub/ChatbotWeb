# ChatbotWeb

This project is a Web-based Chatbot app that gives medical advice and suggest remedies.

It is built with Streamlit Python and connected to OpenAI's turbo-3.5 APIs.
The "advices" used for the chatbot's replies are inspired by https://medium.com/@oluseyejeremiah/building-an-effective-and-user-friendly-medical-chatbot-with-openai-and-cometllm-a-step-by-step-0c822f9bf47b
